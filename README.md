# adversarial.js

Break neural networks in your browser. Just for the fun of it.

An interactive, in-browser demonstration of adversarial attacks on neural networks – entirely in JavaScript.

## Get Started

[Try the demo!](https://kennysong.github.io/adversarial.js)

## Implementation

adversarial.js is completely implemented in JavaScript – so it can run entirely within your browser. We rely on TensorFlow.js.

The library supports the following attacks:

* [Fast Gradient Sign Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf) (L_inf attack)
* [Basic Iterative Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02533.pdf) (L_inf attack)
* [Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07528.pdf) (L0 attack)
* [Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack, One-Pixel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07528.pdf) (L0 attack)
* [Carlini & Wagner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04644.pdf) (L2 attack)

The demo can break the following pre-loaded systems:

* MNIST (digit recognition)
* GTSRB (street sign recognition)
* CIFAR-10 (object recognition, small images)
* ImageNet (object recognition, large images)
